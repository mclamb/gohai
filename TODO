  type, version, family, package formats, etc.)

* Expand on the above plugin to include information about md and dm
  virtual devices on Linux systems.

# These two are kinda done by parsing lshw output
* Add a plugin that knows how to get information about hardware RAID arrays.

  /sys/class/block.
